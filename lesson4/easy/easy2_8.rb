# 1 - creating objects allows programmers to think more 
  # abstractly about code they are writing

# 2 - objects are represented by nouns so are easier to 
  # conceptualize
  
# 3 - it allows us to only expose functionality to the parts
  # of code taht need it, meaning namespace issues are much
  # harder to come across

# 4 - it allows us to easily give functionality to different
  # parts of an application without duplication
  
# 5 - we can build applications faster as we can reuse 
  # pre-written code
  
# 6 - as the software becomes more complex this complexity
  # can be more easily managed.
